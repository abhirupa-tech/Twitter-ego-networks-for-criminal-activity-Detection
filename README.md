# Twitter Ego Networks for Criminal Activity Detection

This project implements the Watson Tone Analyzer on Tweets to detect criminal activity. It leverages ego networks from Twitter to analyze and identify potential criminal behavior.

## Features
- **Data Collection**: Scrapes Twitter data for analysis.
- **Tone Analysis**: Uses Watson Tone Analyzer to evaluate the sentiment and tone of tweets.
- **Network Generation**: Constructs ego networks to visualize and analyze user interactions.
- **Criminal Detection**: Identifies tweets with potential criminal activity based on tone and network analysis.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abhirupa-tech/Twitter-ego-networks-for-criminal-activity-Detection.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Twitter-ego-networks-for-criminal-activity-Detection
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the data scraping script:
   ```bash
   python ScrapeData.ipynb
   ```
2. Perform tone analysis on the collected tweets:
   ```bash
   python Tone_Analyzer.ipynb
   ```
3. Generate and analyze ego networks:
   ```bash
   python generate_network.ipynb
   ```
